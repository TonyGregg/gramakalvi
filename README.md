## Adding git repo to git pages
-- --- ---- ------ -------- ------- ---

Always follow the latest document from https://github.com/angular-schule/angular-cli-ghpages
During cli-ghpages install, use @latest
Use --baseref all the time, Otherwise you get 404 error.  for example.
 ng deploy --base-href=/gramakalvi/
  After making changes to the code, 1. Run the ng deploy command (above) and 2. Commit and push it to  github for it to reflect
My sample organization git page is @ https://tonygregg.github.io/gramakalvi/
Always use the latest npm before updating angular cli
